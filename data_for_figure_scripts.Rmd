```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Final data cleaning steps that import level and plasticity divergence information from DESeq2 and Heiarchical clustering. The end result of this script is a dataframe, finaldf, that is used in all the figure scripts

```{r}
sapply(c("dplyr", "purrr", "tidyr", "ggpubr", "readr",
         "data.table", "ggplot2", "data.table", 
         "matrixStats"), require, character.only=TRUE)
